# PCA Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** from scratch as well as using popular Python libraries. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in machine learning and data analysis to reduce the number of features while retaining most of the variance in the dataset.
